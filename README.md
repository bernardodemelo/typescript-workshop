# Typescript Workshop
Repo for the TypeScript Workshop done on Ironhack's Career Week.

### TypeScript
TypeScript is a Programming Language developed by Microsoft with the intention of fulfill the lacks of JavaScript. By that, the biggest argument of TS is having the feature of static-typing. Static Typing is the action of writing and defining the type of a variable at its declaration. With Static Typing and the help of other features such as Intellisense, creation of Interfaces and Type Aliases, TS turns out to be a language preferred for Medium-Big Enterprises - it is far more secure and criterious than its rebel young brother, JavaScript.

However, it's still JS on steroids. 

Hope you enjoyed the workshop!
